What is language?
A language is software, which provides set of instructions for developing software’s.
Language acts as mediator between user and computer.

Computer languages are classified into two categories.
1.	Low Level Programming Languages
2.	High Level Programming Languages

Low Level Programming Languages
Computer understandable languages are called low level programming languages.

1. Machine Language
2. Assembly Language

Machine Language
Machine language instructions are represented in 0’s and 1’s.
Computer understands only one language called machine language.
Machine language instructions are machine dependent (OR) hardware dependent.

 
Machine language instructions are not easy to understand.
Machine Language does not require any translator.

Assembly Language
Assembly language is low level language, but instructions are not given in 0’s and 1’s but instructions are represented in mnemonics (verbs).

What is assembler?
Assembler is a translator used by assembly language for converting assembly language instructions into machine language.

Low level languages are non portable or hardware dependent.


High Level Programming Languages
All high level programming languages are in simple English. 
High level programming languages are hardware independent.
Using high level programming languages, programmer can develop and run applications on different hardware architecture.

Example: C,C++,COBOL,PASCAL,Java,Python,.Net,JavaScript

What is translator?
Translator is software, which convert instructions of one language to another language.

1. Interpreter
2. Compiler
