What is translator?
Translator is software, which converts instructions of one language to another language.

1. Interpreter
2. Compiler

What is program?
A program is set of instructions.

What is source program?
A program written in high level programming language is called source program.

 


What is interpreter?
Interpreter is a translator, which translates and executes instructions line by line.

 



Interpreter stops translating and executing, if there is an error in one line. Interpreted code executed by machine directly. 
Interpreter displays one error at a time. Debugging program is complex.

Scripting languages uses interpreter as a translator.

What is compiler?
Compiler is a translator, which translates whole program and execute.



 


Compiler display all error exist within program. If there is error within program, compiler not generates executable code/file.



What is scripting language?
A scripting language is one type of programming language which is used for writing scripts.

What is a script?
A script is a small program executed within another program.
Scripts are embedded within another program.
Scripts are used for automation.

Example: Java script, VBscript, typescript, Perl, PHP,..
 
A script cannot execute individually. It is embedded within another program and executed.
A programming language can be used as a scripting language. 
Scripting language cannot be used as a programming language.

Programming paradigm
A programming paradigm defines a set of rules and regulations for writing programs.
1.	Procedural Oriented Programming (POP)
2.	Modular Oriented Programming (MOP)
3.	Object Oriented Programming (OOP)
4.	Functional Oriented Programming (FOP)


C is a Procedural oriented programming language
C++ is Object Oriented Programming Language
Java is Object Oriented Programming Language
Python is Object Oriented Programming Language
C#.Net is Object Oriented Programming Language
