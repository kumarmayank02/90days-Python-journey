High Level
Python is high level programming language and all high level programming language is in simple English.

Portable
Portability allows developing and running python program on any device or hardware architecture.

Embeddable and Extensible
Using python code inside other programming languages is called embeddable.
Using other languages code within python is called extensible

Robust
Robust means strong
Python is very strong in error checking.
Python provides an exception handling, using which a program can handle runtime error to avoid abnormal termination program.


Python Software
Python software is free to download.

Python Distributions
Python distribution is python software bundle which consists of,
1.	Python software
2.	Application Specific Libraries
3.	Editors or IDE


•	ActiveState ActivePython (commercial and community versions, including scientific computing modules)
•	pythonxy (Scientific-oriented Python Distribution based on Qt and Spyder)
•	winpython (WinPython is a portable scientific Python distribution for Windows)
•	Conceptive Python SDK (targets business, desktop and database applications)
•	Enthought Canopy (a commercial distribution for scientific computing)
•	PyIMSL Studio (a commercial distribution for numerical analysis – free for non-commercial use)

PyPy (A fast python implementation with a JIT compiler)
Stackless Python (Branch of CPython supporting microthreads)
MicroPython (Python running on micro controllers)




Python working modes
Python working modes are two,
1.	Interactive mode
2.	Scripting mode/programming mode
