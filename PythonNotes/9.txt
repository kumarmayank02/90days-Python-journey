Character set of python

Character set defines encoding and decoding standard used by python programming language.
Character set defines set of characters supported by python programming language.

There are two encoding standards supported by python language
1.	ASCII   American Standard Code for information Interchange
2.	UNICODE  Universal code

ASCII support 256 characters 0-255, these 256 characters includes
Characters in English (a-z,A-Z), Digits (0-9), Sepcial characters (+,-,*,/,%#!,…)

UNICODE super set of ASCII, It support characters of ASCII and also having more number of characters support from other languages.

UNICODE support more than 1,00,000 characters. 

Python and all  modern languages support ascii and Unicode character set.

 

Uppercase Letters A – 65
			    B -66
			   …
			   Z – 90
Lowercase Letters a -97
			     b-98
			     …
                               z-122

 

 

Tokens
A token is smallest individual unit within program.
Without tokens a statement cannot created.

1.	Keywords
2.	Identifiers
3.	Literals
4.	Data types
5.	Operators


Keywords
Keywords are language related words. The meaning of keyword is reserved by python translator. 
Each keyword is used to perform specific operation.


How to find keywords of python?

>>> import keyword
>>> keyword.kwlist
['False', 'None', 'True', 'and', 'as', 'assert', 'async', 'await', 'break', 'class', 'continue', 'def', 'del', 'elif', 'else', 'except', 'finally', 'for', 'from', 'global', 'if', 'import', 'in', 'is', 'lambda', 'nonlocal', 'not', 'or', 'pass', 'raise', 'return', 'try', 'while', 'with', 'yield']

How many keywords are in python?
>>> len(keyword.kwlist)
35

Python 3.12 version supports 35 keywords.
Python is case-sensitive language; it finds the difference between uppercase and lowercase.

Soft Keywords
Soft keywords can be used as user defined word or identifiers. 

>>> keyword.softkwlist
['_', 'case', 'match', 'type']

Identifiers
Identifier is programmer defined words or user defined words. Identifier is used to identify programming elements.

1.	Variable names
2.	Function names
3.	Data type names
4.	Program name / Module name
5.	Package name

Identifier is a single word, this word is created using alphabets (a-z, A-Z), digits (0-9) and one special character (_)
