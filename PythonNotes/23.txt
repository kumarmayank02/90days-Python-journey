Command line arguments
The values send to python program from command prompt or command line is called command line arguments.

Command line arguments are used to develop utilities or tools or commands in python.

The values send from command prompt are stored in one variable called argv. It is a predefined variable/object exists in sys module.

Control Statements

1.	Conditional Control Statements
a.	If
b.	Match
2.	Looping control Statements
a.	While
b.	For
c.	Nested looping
3.	Branching Statements
a.	Break
b.	Continue
c.	Pass
d.	Return


Control statements are used to control the flow of execution of program.

Control statements are three types

1.	Conditional control statements
2.	Looping control statements
3.	Branching statements

Conditional Control Statements
Python support two conditional control statements
1.	if
2.	match (python 3.10)

Conditional control statements are used to execute block of statements based on condition or selection.

If statement
if is keyword which represent conditional statement.

Types of if syntax
1.	simple if
2.	if..else
3.	if..elif..else (if..else ladder)
4.	nested if

simple if

if without else is called simple if.

Syntax:

If <condition>:
    Statement-1
    Statement-2
Statement-3

If condition is True, PVM executes Statement-1,Statement-2 and Statement-3
If condition is False, PVM executes statement-3	 



In python block must have one statement.s


Example:
if 10>5:
    print("Python")
print("Hello")

if 5>10:
    print("Java")
print("Bye")

if 2>10:
    print(".Net")
    print("Good")

Output:
Python
Hello
Bye

Example:
if 10>5:
    pass

print("a")
print("b")

Output:
a
b

pass keyword
The pass statement is used as a placeholder for future code. When the pass statement is executed, nothing happens, but you avoid getting an error when empty code is not allowed. Empty code is not allowed in loops, function definitions, class definitions, or in if statements.






Example:
if 10>5:
    pass
    print("Hello")

Output:
Hello

If..else

This syntax is having two blocks
1.	if block
2.	else block

Syntax:

If <condition>:
   Statement-1
   Statement-2
else:
   Statement-3
   Statement-4

Statement-5

If condition is True, PVM executes Statement-1,Statement-2 and Statement-5
If condition is False, PVM executes Statement-3, Statement4 and Statement-5
	 


Example:

# Write a program to verify input number divisible with 7 or not

num=int(input("Enter any number "))
if num%7==0:
    print(f'{num} is divisible with 7')
else:
    print(f'{num} is not divisible with 7')

Output:
Enter any number 14
14 is divisible with 7

Enter any number 12
12 is not divisible with 7

Example:

# Write a program to display "Hello" if input number is multiples of 5 else display "Bye"

num=int(input("Enter any Number "))
if num%5==0:
    print("Hello")
else:
    print("Bye")



Output:
Enter any Number 20
Hello

Enter any Number 22
Bye
