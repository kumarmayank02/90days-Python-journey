Python History
Python was conceived in the late 1980s by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands as a successor to the ABC programming language, which was inspired by SETL, capable of exception handling and interfacing with the Amoeba operating system. Its implementation began in December 1989.
First Version of python is released in the year 1991.
Python is product of or Python language is managed by non-profit organization called PSF (Python Software Foundation).
Python language is implemented or developed in C language.
Python language is developed by taking features from various programming languages.
1.	C	(Procedural Oriented Programming)
2.	C++  (Object Oriented Programming)
3.	Perl (Scripting Language)
4.	Modula7  (Modular Programming)

Python name is taken from a comedy series called “Monty Python’s Flying Circus”

Python Versions
Versions are nothing but changes within python language or software.
Python comes in 3 Versions.

1.	Python 1
2.	Python 2
3.	Python 3

1,2,3 are called major releases or versions of python language. There is no compatibility between major versions.
Python 1  python 1.0,Python 1.1,Python 1.2, Python 1.3
Python 2  Python 2.0,Python 2.1,Python 2.2,…. 2.7
Python 3  Python 3.0,Python 3.1,Python 3.2,Python 3.4 .. Python 3.12

Python 1 and 2 are outdated and not used by software companies.
Software companies currently using python3 version. There is compatibility between minor versions ( Python 3.1  Python 3.2).

What is PEP?
PEP stands for Python Enhancement Proposal. It is a technical document which consists of changes done within python language.

Python 3.12  PEP 693
Python 3.11  PEP 664
