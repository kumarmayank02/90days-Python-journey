String

String is non numeric data type.
String is a collection of characters. These characters can be alphabets, digits or special characters.
A string which consists of only alphabets is called alphabetic string.
A string which consists of alphabets or digits is called alphanumeric string.
String is a collection type or sequence type.
String is an immutable sequence data type.

In python string is represented,
1.	Within single quotes
2.	Within double quotes
3.	Within triple single quotes or double quotes

Within single quotes, python programmers represent single line string.
Within single quotes, we can insert double quotes.

Example:
>>> s1='python'
>>> s1
'python'
>>> s2='python 3.12'
s2
>>> 'python 3.12'
>>> s3='45'
>>> n1=45
>>> n1+10
55
>>> s3+10
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<pyshell#19>", line 1, in <module>
    s3+10
TypeError: can only concatenate str (not "int") to str
>>> s4='python is a
SyntaxError: incomplete input
>>> s4='python is "high" programming language'
>>> print(s4)
python is "high" programming language
>>> s5='python is a 'high level' programming language'
SyntaxError: invalid syntax

Within double quotes we can represent single line string

>>> str1="python"
>>> print(str1)
python
>>> str2="python 3.12"
>>> print(str2)
python 3.12
>>> str3="45"
>>> print(str3)
45
>>> str4="python is high level
SyntaxError: incomplete input

Within double quotes we can insert single quotes

>>> str5="python is 'high level' programming language"
>>> print(str5)
python is 'high level' programming language

Within triple single quotes or double quotes we can represent multiline string.

>>> rollno=101
>>> name="nk"
>>> course="FSP"
>>> description=''' Full Stack Python consists of 5 Modules
Module1: Python
Module2: Database
Module3: UI
Module4: Backend
Module5: Tools'''
>>> print(rollno)
101
>>> print(name)
nk
>>> print(course)
FSP
>>> print(description)
 Full Stack Python consists of 5 Modules
Module1: Python
Module2: Database
Module3: UI
Module4: Backend
Module5: Tools
>>> str1=""" Python is
... high level, multiparadigm
... programming language"""
>>> print(str1)
 Python is
high level, multiparadigm
programming language


Comments in Python

In python comments are created using # (pound sign)
It is used to create single line comment.

test1.py
# This is my first program in python

print("Hello") # this statement is used to print a message Hello

Output:
Hello

test2.py
a=''' This is my first python program '''

print("Hello")
print(a)
Output:
Hello
This is my first python program

What is indent?
Space given at the beginning of the statement is called indent.
Indent is used to create block.

 

Every program required 3 things,
1.	Output
2.	Input
3.	Process
