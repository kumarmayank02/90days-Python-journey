Python is pure object oriented programming language. Every data type in python is a class and data is represented as objects.

What is class?
A class represents data type.
Class is used to allocate memory for data or object.
Class defines structure of object.
Class is a blue print of object
Class defines properties and behavior of object.
Properties defines the values hold by object
Behavior defines the functionality of object

What is object?
An object is instance of a class
Allocating memory for members/properties of the class is process of creating object.
Object is an implementation of a class.

 
 



 
Python is a dynamically typed programming language, variables are not bind with specific data type or variables are not declared with any data type.

Statically Typed Programming Language

int a;
a=10;
a=1.5; Error



	Dynamically typed programming language

a=10
type(a) ðŸ¡ª int
a=1.5
type(a) ðŸ¡ª float

What is variable?
Variable is an identifier, which is used to identify value/object.
Variable is named memory location.

int data type

int data type/class is used to construct integer objects.
Int data type is used by python virtual machine for allocating memory for integer value/literal.
Integer is a numeric value without fractional part.

Eg: 1, 560, 5789

>>> a=123
>>> type(a)
<class 'int'>
>>> a
123
>>> b=560
>>> type(b)
<class 'int'>
>>> b
560

In python integer values are represented in 4 formats
1.	Decimal 
2.	Octal
3.	Hexadecimal
4.	Binary

Number system define set of rules and regulations for representing numbers in computer science.

Size of int data type is dynamic. The memory is allocated based value size. Int data type size is unlimited.

>>> x=9999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999
>>> x
9999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999
>>> import sys
>>> sys.getsizeof(x)
56
>>> y=100
>>> sys.getsizeof(y)
28
>>> z=8999999999999999999
>>> sys.getsizeof(z)
36

Decimal Integer
An integer value with base 10 is called decimal integer.
This integer is created using all the digits from 0-9.
This integer is not prefix with 0
This integer is prefix with + or â€“
Default representation of integer values are in decimal format.

>>> a=0123
SyntaxError: leading zeros in decimal integer literals are not permitted; use an 0o prefix for octal integers
