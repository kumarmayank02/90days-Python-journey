'''What is a Data Type?
Data type specifies the type of value a variable holds. This is required in programming to do various operations without causing an error.
In python, we can print the type of any operator using type function:'''

a = 1
print(type(a))
b = "1"
print(type(b))

d=3.5
e="kumar"
print("type of d",type(d));
print("type of e",type(e));


#complex number
f=complex(5,2)
print(f);

##int
e=2
print(e)

#String

g="This is Kumar Mayank"
print(g)

#boolean
h=True
print(h)

#Sequenced data:list,tuple
list1  = [9,3,4.6],[-8,9]
["apple","Orange"]
print(list1)

tuple1 =(("parrot",
          "sparrow"),("lion","Elephant"))
print(tuple1)


#Mapped data:dict

dict1={"name":"Mayank","age":20,"canEligible":True}
print(dict1)



#NOTES OF ALL DATATYPES 

'''(1). Numeric data: int, float, complex
int: 3, -8, 0
float: 7.349, -9.0, 0.0000001
complex: 6 + 2i
(2). Text data: str
str: "Hello World!!!", "Python Programming"

(3). Boolean data:
Boolean data consists of values True or False.

(4). Sequenced data: list, tuple
list: A list is an ordered collection of data with elements separated by a comma and enclosed within square brackets. Lists are mutable and can be modified after creation.

uple: A tuple is an ordered collection of data with elements separated by a comma and enclosed within parentheses. Tuples are immutable and can not be modified after creation.

(5). Mapped data: dict
dict: A dictionary is an unordered collection of data containing a key:value pair. The key:value pairs are enclosed within curly brackets.'''
